The Turner Method
As Applied to Back-Dated POS/ATM Transactions

1. Note the time the transaction was authorized
(not posted) in A-Bubble

2. Find the last transaction that posted before this
in transaction history and note the ledger balance
after it.

3. Add up all holds that were active at the time
the transaction was authorized.

4. Subtract this total from the previously obtained
ledger balance.

This will give you the available balance in the account
at the time the transaction was authorized and will help
you to confirm whether or not a courtesy pay fee
should have been charged
